    text: "Cornerstone Waterproofing did an excellent job fixing a leak in our basement. The quality of their work surpassed our expectations and the cost was competitive. The crew was skilled and courteous. They showed up on time every day, worked hard, tidied up and covered everything at the end of each day, and got the job done on time. The final step of laying a concrete patch had to be delayed for some time after the waterproofing was complete. Their lead man explained the reasons and the risk of the concrete cracking if it were done too quickly. We wholeheartedly recommend Cornerstone Waterproofing.",

    text: "Cornerstone was recommended to us by friends. This is a family-owned and run business that takes great pride in its work. From start to finish Saverio LoMonaco and his crew were prompt, friendly, efficient and performed excellent work. There is still one part of the work to be completed (the laying of concrete to repair the pathway) because the work already completed requires time to settle. Other contractors might have proceeded only to produce problems up the road. I highly recommend Cornerstone.",

    text: "Saverio and his crew dug out and underpinned my basement. The service, in terms of job completion, communication throughout, finishing and even offering advice and suggesting other contractors to help complete my project. This was my first big reno and I had never been my own general contractor before. With Saverio's assistance, I was able to lower my basement floor by 24 inches, reroute the sewage, waterproof, and build an escape access from the basement. He and his crew were fast, and he communicated with me throughout the project, which helped with peace of mind. He even suggested great, professional contractors that allowed me to finish my project. All-around I highly recommend Cornerstone.",

    text: "Exceptional service. Exceptional work. We had an excellent experience with Saverio and his crew. From the get-go Saverio was available to answer all my questions thoughtfully and honestly about underpinning our basement and never tried to push us to make a quick decision. The crew that works for him were at our house at the same time every day, entirely respectful of our neighbours and finished the project on schedule. Since the completion of our basement project Saverio continues to be invaluable to use as a problem solver when we had an issue with the city pipes outside of our house. I highly recommend Cornerstone Waterproofing for anyone that is looking for high-quality, reliable service!",

The job site was left clean and neat. I would highly recommend them and would use them again. Dug down to foundation and replaced old weeping tile.",

    text: "We had some deteriorating bricks on the west side of our house that, quite frankly, seemed like they could become an issue down the road. My wife contacted Saverio and he came by within an hour to assess and followed up within a day with a written quote. The work started the following week and was done within 5 days. Saverio and his team were efficient, tidy, and the job they did looks OUTSTANDING. Saverio even came back after the job was done to personally address a couple of concerns I had. 10/10, I have no doubt we will hire cornerstone again for any future waterproofing and basement needs that arise.",

    text: "Following Cornerstone installing post and beams of our home in December, they underpinned the basement in January. I have nothing but praise for Saverio and his team. They worked diligently, showed up on time daily. This is long, lengthy and dusty project and they came through with honors. I would like to think my baking helped. I would not hesitate to recommend them for the specialized services they perform. Underpinning and dropping basement floor.",

    text: "I spent months researching underpinners and contacting references and finally decided to hire Saverio at Cornerstone Waterproofing and I did not regret it. I tend to get very involved with the projects and I am very particular in how I oversee a project. Saverio was very responsive on text, phone and email and always answered my questions and put my fears to rest. Whenever I had a concern, he was open to hear me out and always responded accordingly by making the necessary changes. His team works very hard and I never felt uncomfortable to have them in and out of my home. They kept as clean as possible and made sure to seal everything up tight at the end of each day. They kept consistent and good hours and did great work. As far as price goes, his quote was pretty consistent to other quotes but I can tell you from experience that his customer service is enough hidden added value that you will also not regret hiring him.",

    text: "Cornerstone underpinned our house, dropping it almost two feet. We cannot speak highly enough of Saverio and his crew. The job took approximately three months, and we could not be happier with the work. The crew were extremely respectful of our home, and were always cheerful and happy to provide us with updates. The quality of the work was exceptional, and for such a big job, we felt in good and safe hands from day one. We recommend Cornerstone 100%, for any job, big to huge. Great company.",

    text: "Where do I begin. Saverio and his team Brian and Kyle went above and beyond our expectations. They are very professional, hard working, friendly, very accommodating, always available for questions. It truly was stress free for us. They take pride in their work and so they should. We could not believe what is involved in doing this reno. They even removed our old wood beam and replaced it with a steel beam. Saverio really makes you feel at ease even with my many questions. We cannot thank them enough for their amazing work. We are only sad we didn't do this years ago. We would definitely recommend this great team. Lowering Basement and Underpinning.",

    text: "No words to explain the professionalism of this contractor, Saverio and his crew - Matt and Anthony. Plans were to begin and finish in the summer and to do the work, the furnace needed to be disconnected and duct work taken down. Then we ran into trouble with delays with CAD designer and his contractor who could not prove he had insurance coverage and so we cancelled using him. Now it's September and we were scrambling, knowing winter and frozen pipes are soon. Looking for other options, we met Cornerstone. Saverio assured us that he would fit us in before the frost hit. With his quote, he provided his insurance liability certificate. True to his word the job was done with his great crew work diligently for 4 days perfectly timed for the heating and AC crew to arrive to put everything together, just in time for single digits temps. Honestly, it was lovely to work with this company and would never hesitate to recommend them. Post and Beam replacement.",

Removed and cement blocked in an old window inside. The work was completed quickly and the site was left clean and tidy. Back foundation wall waterproofing.",

    text: "We were referred to Saverio from Cornerstone Waterproofing by our architect and we are so happy that we were. From our first meeting with Saverio we knew that he was honest, reliable, professional, knowledgeable and competent. The scope of our project included underpinning the entire perimeter of our basement, lowering it from 6ft to 8ft ceilings and all the other things that are involved when you lower your basement (sump pump, waste injector, interior waterproofing, new drains, concrete floor and a few extras that we asked for). Brian and Kyle (Saverio's crew) are so friendly, easy to be around and hard working. These guys are truly wonderful people (even several of our neighbours mentioned how great they were). For 6 weeks these guys came to our house on time, never complained about being in a dark and dirty basement and were so kind to our boys. The project finished on time and on budget and was completely stress free for us. Since they finished we have called Saverio several times to ask him questions and he is always happy to help us. We highly recommend Cornerstone Waterproofing and would definitely use them again if we needed to.",

    text: "I am a general contractor in Toronto. Our company does home renovations that run the gamut. We hired Cornerstone Waterproofing for the digging, excavating, beam and column replacement, waterproofing and new slab pour for a basement we are currently finishing in Toronto. Saverio and his team are exceptional. The quality of work leaves nothing to be desired. More importantly, as a contractor, I had to do no baby sitting whatsoever. Saverio understood what was needed from day one and lead his team through the job. Very few questions were asked and I was able to continue my work elsewhere while Cornerstone took care of this part of the job for me. Professional, courteous, timely, organized and refreshing. I have already included Cornerstone Waterproofing in two other potential jobs we will take on. 10/10. Basement excavation, underpin and new slab.",
